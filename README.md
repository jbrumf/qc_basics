#### An Introduction to the Basics of Quantum Computing

This project contains the source files for "Quantum Computing Basics", which is an introduction to quantum computing, focusing on the software, quantum information and simulation aspects.

The HTML version of the document can be found at:

- [https://jbrumf.github.io/qc_basics/Quantum_computing_basics.html](https://jbrumf.github.io/qc_basics/Quantum_computing_basics.html)

It was originally written to accompany the author's TinyQsim project:

- [https://jbrumf.github.io/tinyqsim](https://jbrumf.github.io/tinyqsim/)

However, it is not specific to TinyQsim, so it has been moved to this new project.
